                       Instructions
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Below is a list of main programs in the "examples" directory.

 1) With the right bottom select MARK (in English system) to select the file.
    DO NOT INCLUDE THE ".f90"

 2) Carefully select the file and then hit the RETURN key

 3) With the right button select PASTE and then hit the RETURN key

 4) Now type 
              a) FULL to recompile all 
              b) MAIN for main program only 
              c) LINK to link only (somewhat useless option ...)
              d) Hit the return key to ABORT

 5) A folder named after your main program will be created with the executable
    in the folder example_executable

    N.B. Drag and drop works in DOS Terminals. Also the up and down arrows.
